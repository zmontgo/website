There have been a thousand poets, authors, artists, musicians, thinkers, and feelers who have tried to crystallize the feeling of this place into words. The one common thread is awestruck naivety.

In the most naive and genuine way I can, I will take my turn. This poem was written late in the night, staring through a window of my memory, as I recalled my trip to Colorado.

**Colorado**\
*By Zachary Montgomery*

```
Everything's just fuller here,
The memory is fuller too.
I need to sit for ages, silently,
Or I'll never feel that truth.

I'll remember here forever,
I'll remember remembering too,
The now and future endeavor,
The things I've yet to do.

The painting's beautiful, isn't it?
Those craggy timeless stones,
Or the reaching hands of flora,
Like starry astral bones.

It's really softly peaceful here,
And it's beautiful here, too,
I'll sit here for hours, just listening,
Rephrasing; I'll remember you.
```

Stepping out of the airport was the moment I realized I would never be able to fully feel it. A week is too short to know you love a place.
A transcient moment, too short to even realize what you're processing. In some ways, I feel like life is just a moment. Too short to realize what you're processing, too short to realize you love it.

From the start, all around me were skies and mountains with trees, so impressive as to feel like they were impressed upon the sky's mantle, and not the earth's, and it reached up and all around me.
The air was thinner and sweeter, and as the night fell it brought a chill, a gentle chill that made me feel alive, as though I was in and part of a place that was alive.

I am not sad I have left. It forces me to remember. I remember, also, a quote from CS Lewis' "Out of the Silent Planet":

> *"A pleasure is full grown only when it is remembered. You are speaking as if the pleasure were one thing and the memory another. It is all one thing."*

This sentiment strikes me powerfully. To be forced to leave &mdash; to reckon with the fact that you will never experience those exact moments again &mdash; is to be forced to remember.
To remember is to experience it. When I was there, my present self was experiencing half, and I trusted my future self, my memory, to experience the other half. Now, I am my future self, and I experience it even now.

I remember a thousand details I couldn't possibly hope to recall. The feeling of the wind, the sun, the smell of the air and the trees, the shape of the mountains against the night sky, a book by a fireplace.
The feel of my bed at night, the taste of the food, walking for hours in the dark talking with a friend with a smile on my face. Even exhaustion, little fears, the ache of walking all day, or the plane ride home.
All of these sum to an experience. I remember it all, and I experience it all.

But what is memory good for without some twinge of regret? I miss it, and I feel that ancient, pervasive awareness that I did not do everything I could have. Did not experience everything I could have, did not take every moment to love it.
I am commonly caught in my head, thinking about my future. An old and familiar estrangement from the present. I am not sad I have left, but I am sad I did not love it more. I am not distraught, were I to be perfect, I wouldn't have enjoyed it at all.
But I am regretful, and in the most trite and cliche way I can word it, I wish I could go back and do it again. I wish I could walk lock-step, right alongside my memory, right alongside my plans.
In a way, this regret is a gift, and it makes the experience *now* all the more powerful.

I have no ultimate point about this post. My propensity for 
Just simple, complex introspection. I will never be able to live that week again, but I am content that I will experience it for the rest of my life, and I will love it.

I already have plans to go back, and I suspect I will love that time even more. But for right now, I am happy to write this, to read this, as this is deeply a part of my experience. I lived, and I loved it.

I like to take naive passion and turn it into beautiful things. I am also a Christian, and may post about that from time to time.

You may notice a distinctive lack of features. I will be working on them intermittently, but I wanted to get this out there. In the future we'll be adding things like a vector-based search, a tag system, and a better way to navigate the site.
Maybe a footer, more content around posts in the [notepad](/notepad) page, a newsletter, and more.

One thing that will **never** be added, however, is a comment section. Apologies, but I write because I want to share, not because I want to read through comments.

This doesn't mean I won't accept feedback, however. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to email me at [contact@zachmontgomery.com](mailto:contact@zachmontgomery.com).

I really would love to hear from you, even if it's just to share your thoughts, or simply say 'Hi.'
